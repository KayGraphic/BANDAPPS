Problem: Summer reading programs go on at libraries all over the country. These summer reading programs keep the kids engaged in reading activity during the summer break. Lot of little libraries (300 - 500 active members) don't have the budget to afford add-ons to existing apps that can track reading.
Solution: An app that can track progress of reading in terms of minutes for students in different age groups.
Students would be able to compare their progress with other students in their age group as well as view their own historical progress.
Grantors might be interested in funding the app.
Positive reinforcement, by way of prizes and books for accomplishing goals, would be a feature.
The app will contain a stop-clock for timing the reading.
The reading itself will not be handled within the app, but externally.
Challenges: For a fun and meaningful feedback, there would have to be significant participation. It depends on how big each community is.
