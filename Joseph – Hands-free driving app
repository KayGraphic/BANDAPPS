Problem: Even though some states have legislated against the use of phones while driving to different extents, there is nothing that can prevent someone from doing so.
Solution: An app that can detect that the phone is used while someone is driving and lock up all the functions of the phone unless it is used hands-free.
It will be hard lock â€“ none of the functions can be used unless the phone is used hands-free or by someone other than the driver.
The app could be mandated for those who have already been found violating the rule once or twice not for others, since it could be an issue of individual liberty.
A picture could be taken by the app to detect the steering wheel and determine that the person using the phone is driving.
Challenges: Coming up with a non-complex way to determine if the person using the phone is driving. Permissions to functions, such as the camera could be a privacy issue.
